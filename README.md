## Steam Helper: Grants you better control of your Steam Game Updates

About a year ago I got tired of Steam randomly doing game updates during the day (I paused and in some rare cases I would lose my internet connection and then gain it again allowing steam to start updates again without me noticing). Due to my poor internet speed this was a problem as YouTube videos would keep buffering etc.

So I made a batch script. This script allows you to set a delay to open steam and start updates. So say if you want to watch YouTube in the morning but have to go to work after an hour and you have Steam game updates to do. Simply open the program and schedule steam to open in a hour. Steam will then be opened by the script when you leave for work.

The script also allows you to shutdown/hibernate/restart your computer after a delay when Steam is opened.
I also added a feature in which your computer can shutdown/hibernate/restart when the script has detected Steam has ceased activity. I also added a failsafe in which it wouldn't shutdown if you've lost internet connection. I like to call this Smart Shutdown xD

Both features above are optional

Seeing as this is a batch script it looks kinda bland but I'm aiming to create a visual application for it and making it cross platform.
It's only usable with the WIindows OS right now.
