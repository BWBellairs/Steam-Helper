##Steam Helper: Grants you better control of your Steam Game Updates

Tired of downloading game updates during the day and want to schedule them for the night?
Or perhaps you want to shutdown your computer or put it to sleep after downloading game updates?

Steam Helper does that for you.
With Added Intelligent shutdown (You can choose to enable this) you can make those things happen
with no time delay but when the script has detected that Steam has ceased activity. It's also smart
enough to not shutdown if you've lost internet connection.

Just download and run the script to use it. It's that simple.

(I'm going to port this to some visual app in the future)

If you do find bugs, please report them by creating an issue.
Thanks, BWBellairs
